Welcome To Sted.

A site who built for being displayed in my portfolio as a medium/ big size project. </br>
The site simulates a social network.
</br></br></br>


The tools i used when buiding Sted: </br>
-) React</br>
-) Redux</br>
-) Thunk</br>
-) React midlleware</br>
-) Pure css/ css3</br>
-) Firebase storage for uploading media.</br>
-) FaunaDB (NoSql database - similar to MongoDB) -> Full contact/ control between front/ backend</br></br></br>


Sted is my first medium/ big project.</br>
During the buliding of the site i learned a lot, In fact every step forward that i took involved new learning (Not only in react,
but also in pure Javascript).</br></br>

Sted contains more than 20 components with 7 diffrent states that was created by redux who communicate amazingly and effectively.</br></br></br>


Have fun while exploring</br></br>
